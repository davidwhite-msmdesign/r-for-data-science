# Data Visualizations - MSM Design

This repository houses visualizations that Iâ€™ve made using Python and R.  My data visualization work focuses on the topic of societal change with a particular interest in the intersection of public education and social justice. I publish a new visualization every day on my blog: https://msmdesign.nyc/insights-made-fresh-daily
